					<h2>Get to Know Jeremy Crawford, your New President and CEO of FMLS</h2>

					<img class="float-right" src="./assets/images/pull-quote.png" alt="">

					<p>When it comes to real estate, this isn't Jeremy’s first rodeo. Like many of you, Jeremy is a seasoned real
						estate professional. But what really sets him apart is his vision of how FMLS and technology will continue
						to
						lead the way in Georgia real estate.</p>


					<p>Before being called to lead FMLS, Jeremy was in several nationally-leading real estate organizations. For
						over
						nine years, he worked at RESO, the nonprofit that creates and promotes technology standards that drive
						efficiency in the real estate industry, rising to their Chief Executive Officer.</p>

					<p>And before that, he was the COO and CIO at MLSListings for over four years, the trend-setting MLS in the
						heart
						of Silicon Valley. He also worked as the CIO at Sandicor in San Diego for over 5 years.</p>

					<p>So to say technology runs in the veins would be understatement.</p>

					<h4>Here are six questions we asked Jeremy about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and
						more…</h4>

					<h4>We’ve seen a lot of changes in the real estate marketplace, with technology leading the way. Where
						do
						you see
						this going with FMLS?</h4>

					<p>“Well, we’re going to make FMLS one of the most technologically advanced MLS’ in the country. But a lot of
						that’s going to be on the backend. Our job is to leverage this technology for brokers and agents – to make
						their job easier, not harder. That’s what the best technology solutions do.”</p>

					<h4>We’ve heard a lot in the news about AI and Machine Learning. It sounds a bit mystifying. Any plans
						for
						that
						with FMLS?</h4>

					<p>Funny you should ask, but yes. Big data is all around us, and we plan to use it help our brokers and
						agents.
						We’re in the process of moving a big part of our MLS platform to the Google Cloud, so we can have access to
						much more data and information that will really help create a much better and more robust MLS.</p>

					<h4>What other things are you working on to help FMLS Brokers?</h4>

					<p>“We just announced a brand new “Coming Soon” status, that will really help our brokers and agents with
						pre-marketing a new listing. Of course, they’ll have to have the a signed listing agreement and have
						approval
						from the seller, but this has been going for a while in real estate and we want to support that business
						model.”</p>

					<img class="float-right" src="./assets/images/190801-img2-a.jpg" alt="">

					<h4>Get to Know Jeremy CrawfordWe’ve heard about an expanded rentals program being developed. What can
						you tell us
						about that?</h4>

					<p>Yes, that’s pretty far along the pipeline, and we’ll be announcing it soon. Basically, it allows FMLS
						members
						to add rental listings, not just for homes, but for apartment listings as well. We want to help our members
						generate revenue whether someone is buying, selling or renting. And being able to earn money from rentals is
						something that’s been on our mind for a long time.</p>

					<h4>Will all of this technology take away from what our Brokers and Agents are doing? What do you see
						happening
						from that perspective?</h4>

					<p>Well, the reality is that consumers are becoming a lot more educated, and not just about real estate. Would
						you ever go into a new car showroom without doing some online research first? That’s what people used to do,
						but not anymore. And it’s the same with real estate. We want to work with our FMLS Brokers and Agents to
						create the best MLS with the right technology so brokers and consumers can work together to make the process
						a
						lot smoother. We’re definitely on the side of our members.</p>

					<h4>Where can we learn more about FMLS and some of the new products coming out?</h4>

					<p>One thing would be to come and attend our Real Estate Showcase in Atlanta on date goes here. You can see
						all
						of the new things we’re doing, and there’s some great panels and speakers that we’re be a part of. It’s a
						great way to see where we’re headed, and ask questions about how you take advantage of what’s happening. It
						really is an exciting time.</p>

					<h2>New “Coming Soon” Status Goes Live – Here’s What You Need to Know</h2>
					<p>The “Coming Soon” status is another first by FMLS, and helps support a business model that’s been in the
						market for a while.</p>

					<p>This can help you create immediate demand for a listing that’s going to coming onto the market, but may not
						be
						quite ready. You can give FMLS agents a head start in working with their buyers, and also generate
						pre-market
						buzz. Ultimately, it can help you sell your listing faster so you and your agents can get paid sooner.
					</p>
					<h4>There’s several things you need to know, however.</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>“Coming Soon” will be a new status option when a listing is first posted to FMLS. A listing in the
							“Coming
							Soon” status will be visible exclusively to all FMLS Members.</li>
						<li>“Coming Soon” will be an “off-market” status. Days-on-Market will not accrue for any time that a listing
							is
							in
							the “Coming Soon” status.</li>
						<li>Only properties with an Exclusive Right to Sell listing agreement and the seller's permission may use
							the
							“Coming Soon” status.</li>
						<li>Properties under the “Coming Soon” status are only available to FMLS members who are logged into Matrix.
							"Coming Soon" listings are not distributed to agent, public-facing or syndication websites, including
							GeorgiaOpenHouses.com, ShowingTime, or the Matrix Consumer Portal.
						</li>
						<li>You must include a Go Active date when using the “Coming Soon” listing status. This is the date you
							expect
							your listing to be active.</li>
						<li>Use of the “Coming Soon” status is limited to 21 days. At midnight of the Go Active date, the listing
							status
							automatically changes to Active. You can, of course, change the status to Active prior to that date.
						</li>
						<li>A listing that was once under the “Coming Soon” status must be off-market for 90+ days before it
							can be
							re-listed in the “Coming Soon” status.</li>
						<li>FMLS rules and regulations for listing entry requirements apply to the new “Coming Soon” status.</li>

						Comments</h2>
					<p>Have you been frustrated when you want to describe a beautiful feature of your listing, but you ran into a
						character count issue?</p>
					<p>As a Broker, you know the importance of positioning and writing about a property, especially higher end
						homes,
						so you can differentiate and sell it faster.</p>
					<p>If you've been in real estate a while, you know the importance of great writing. You've probably even been
						in
						a real estate copywriting seminar at some point of your career.</p>
					<p>And, if your practice is on the luxury side, where properties can easily exceed a million dollars or more,
						you've probably seen that brokers create special collateral, or even a photo book on the property.

						Well, now you can put all your writing skills to work on the web.</p>
					<p>With the new character count increase from FMLS, you can take the time to craft the right kind of
						messaging,
						without the worry of running out of room. It's one more way FMLS continues to advance the marketing of
						Georgia
						real estate.</p>

					<p>That’s why FMLS has expanded the limit from 40 to 75 photos - on every listing.</p>
